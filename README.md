# Mathematical-Surfaces---Compute-Shaders
This repository showcases my completed version of the Mathematical Surfaces - Compute Shaders tutorial by Jasper Flick from Catlike Coding. It features dynamic generation and animation of various mathematical surfaces on the GPU using Unity compute shaders. This project marked an important step in my journey to understanding GPU programming and shader systems more deeply.

what I learned from this project:

- Writing and integrating compute shaders in Unity  
- Performing parallel computations via the GPU  
- Visualizing mathematical functions graphically

Here is the final result of tutorials

### I also did my own hlsl shaders and graphs
